# vinyl-tree
A 2-color vinyl tree stencil to stick on your wall

## Instructions

* Cut out the Trunks and Branches on the base color.
  * I cut out the pattern and then do a vertical flip and print it again
  * I used ''[Repositional Matte Vinyl](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Darts-crafts&field-keywords=repositionable+vinyl&rh=n%3A2617941011%2Ck%3Arepositionable+vinyl)''. Do not use permanant vinyl if you are sticking it to a wall. For a medium tree I used a 12"x10'. For a very large tree I used double that.
* Cut out the leaves/petals on the secondary color
 * I used red for this, you can go crazy and do green petals, pink blossoms, etc.
 * You only need a small amount of vinly for this, maybe 12"x3'?
* I used my hands to do the tree parts, and transfer paper to do the small petals. Basically just stick the thing on the wall?

## File Formats
Sorry I did this in the proprietary Silhouette software. I should have done this originally in native svg format and then import them into the cutting software, because now I can't get them out? Proprietary formats suck. But the Silhouette software was very easy to work with, I may not have done it at all in the first place if it wasn't this easy.
